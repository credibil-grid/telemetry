# Open Telemetry Tracing

This module provides shared tools for configuring Open Telemetry Tracing.

## Unit tests

To run the unit test of this library use the command:

```bash
make test
```

### Coverage Report

To generate a coverage report use the command:

```bash
make coverage
```

It generates a `coverage.html` file in the root directory of the project. Really useful to see how much of the code is covered.
